.Dt CRONTAB 5
.Sh NAME
.Nm crontab
.Nd format of a crontab file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
A
.Nm 
consists of comments, environment settings, and jobs.
.Bl -tag -width Em comments
.It Em environment settings
An environment setting is a line of the form
.Em name Ns = Ns Ar value ,
which is put into the environment of any job run out of
this 
.Nm crontab .
The enviroment setting
.Em MAILTO
tells
.Xr cron 8
to send mail to that user instead of to the user that
owns the crontab.
.It Em comments
A line where the first non-space character is a pound-sign
.Pq Em \&#
is a comment, and is ignored.
.It Em jobs
A job is composed of six fields. 
The fields are separated by spaces or tabs.
The first five are integer patters to specify the minute
.Pq Em 0-59 ,
hour
.Pq Em 0-23 ,
day of the month
.Pq Em 1-31 ,
month of the year
.Pq Em 1-12 ,
and day of the week
.Po Em 0-7
with 1=monday
.Pc
when that job is to be run.
Each of those patterns may contain a number in the range above;
two numbers separated by a minute (meaning the range of numbers
between the two); a list of numbers separated by commas; or an
asterisk meaning all legal values.   
.Pp
Skip values can be used in conjunction with an asterisk, a range,
or a number.  Following a value with
.Dq / Ns Ar number
specifies every 
.Ar number Ns th
value across that range (or, in the case of a simple number, the
range of that number up to the largest value for that field.)
For example,
.Dq Em 1-23/2
means every odd hour of the day
.Pq 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,21,23 .
.Pp
The  sixth field is a string that is executed by the shell at
the specified times.
A non-escaped percent character
.Pq Em \&%
in this field is translated to a new-line character.
Only the first line
.Po
up to a
.Em \&%
or end of line
.Pc
is executed by the shell.  The other lines are made available to the
command as standard input.
