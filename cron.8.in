.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Cron
executes commands at specified dates and times according to the
instructions in
.Xr crontab 5
files in
.Pa /var/spool/cron/crontabs .
When
.Nm cron
is running, it wakes up every minute, checks to see if any of the
.Ar crontabs 
in
.Pa /var/spool/cron/crontabs
contain jobs to be run, then runs them and mails the output (if any)
to the owner of the crontab (or to the user named in the 
.Em MAILTO
environment variable defined in the crontab.)
.Pp
.Nm Cron
normally examines
.Pa /var/spool/cron
every minute, but this interval can be increased by the command-line
argument
.Ar interval ,
which is the number of minutes between
.Nm cron
runs.
.Sh BUGS
.Nm
doesn't understand the idea of daylight savings time.
